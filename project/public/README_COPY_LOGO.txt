Copy your logo image into this public folder as logo.jpg so the app and favicon will use it.

Example (PowerShell):

# from the path you provided
Copy-Item "C:\Users\rajat\Downloads\Neeledger\WhatsApp Image 2025-09-24 at 12.39.35_3ce95db9.jpg" -Destination "C:\Users\rajat\Downloads\Neeledger\project\public\logo.jpg"

After copying, restart the dev server (npm run dev) and refresh the browser. If the favicon is cached, do a hard refresh or open an incognito window.
